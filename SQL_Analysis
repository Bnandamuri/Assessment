Data Cleaning Summary
This repository contains cleaned and standardized datasets prepared for exploratory and analytical use. The original CSV files presented a number of data quality issues that were addressed using Power Query transformations.

# SQL Analysis: Fetch Dataset Insights

This file contains annotated SQL queries used to analyze the Fetch Takehome dataset. All queries were developed and tested using ****SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).****

## 1. Top 5 Brands by Receipts Scanned (Age â‰¥ 21)
This query finds the top 5 brands based on the number of distinct receipts scanned by users who are 21 or older.

```
SELECT TOP 5
    p.BRAND,
	-- Calculating the unique receipts 
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.RECEIPT_ID) AS receipts_scanned
FROM dbo.transactions_cleaned t
JOIN dbo.users_cleaned u
    ON t.USER_ID = u.ID
JOIN dbo.products_cleaned p
    ON t.BARCODE = p.BARCODE
	-- Filtering out the users who are 21 and over. 
WHERE DATEDIFF(YEAR, u.BIRTH_DATE, GETDATE()) >= 21
GROUP BY p.BRAND
ORDER BY Receipts_Scanned DESC.

## 2. ðŸ§¬ Health & Wellness Sales Percentage by Generation
**This query classifies users into generational cohorts (Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, Boomers) based on their birth year, and calculates what percentage of each generation's total spend went toward the Health & Wellness category.

## 3. Product Data (`PRODUCTS_TAKEHOME.csv`)
### Issues Identified:
- Incomplete records with missing `CATEGORY_1` or `CATEGORY_2`.
- Blank strings in `CATEGORY_3` and `CATEGORY_4`.
- Unclean values in `BRAND` and `MANUFACTURER`.
### Actions Taken:
- Removed rows with missing primary category fields.
- Substituted blanks in lower-level category fields with `"Unspecified"`.
- Standardized formatting by trimming whitespace across all text columns.
---
##  Outcome
All three datasets were cleaned with a focus on:
- Preserving key business logic.
- Preparing for reliable joins across `USER_ID` and `BARCODE`.
- Ensuring minimal information loss while improving data integrity.

The cleaned outputs are ready for downstream analysis and modeling.
